## Telegram messenger CLI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vysheng/tg.png)](https://travis-ci.org/vysheng/tg)

Command-line interface for [Telegram](http://telegram.org). Uses readline interface.

### API, Protocol documentation

Documentation for Telegram API is available here: http://core.telegram.org/api

Documentation for MTproto protocol is available here: http://core.telegram.org/mtproto

### Upgrading to version 1.0

First of all, the binary is now in ./bin folder and is named telegram-cli. So be careful, not to use old binary.

Second, config folder is now ${HOME}/.telegram-cli

Third, database is not compatible with older versions, so you'll have to login again.

Fourth, in peer_name '#' are substitued to '@'. (Not applied to appending of '#%d' in case of two peers having same name).

### Installation

Clone GitHub Repository

     git clone --recursive https://github.com/vysheng/tg.git && cd tg

### Python Support

Python support is currently limited to Python 2.7 or Python 3.1+. Other versions may work but are not tested.

#### Linux and BSDs

Install libs: readline, openssl and (if you want to use config) libconfig, liblua, python and libjansson.
If you do not want to use them pass options --disable-libconfig, --disable-liblua, --disable-python and --disable-json respectively.

On Ubuntu/Debian use: 

     sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev libconfig-dev libssl-dev lua5.2 liblua5.2-dev libevent-dev libjansson-dev libpython-dev make 

On gentoo:

     sudo emerge -av sys-libs/readline dev-libs/libconfig dev-libs/openssl dev-lang/lua dev-libs/libevent dev-libs/jansson dev-lang/python

On Fedora:

     sudo dnf install lua-devel openssl-devel libconfig-devel readline-devel libevent-devel libjansson-devel python-devel

On Archlinux:

     yaourt -S telegram-cli-git

On FreeBSD:

     pkg install libconfig libexecinfo lua52 python

On OpenBSD:

     pkg_add libconfig libexecinfo lua python

On openSUSE:

     sudo zypper in lua-devel libconfig-devel readline-devel libevent-devel libjansson-devel python-devel libopenssl-devel

Then,

     ./configure
     make

#### Other methods to install on linux

On Gentoo: use ebuild provided.

On Arch: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/telegram-cli-git

#### Mac OS X

The client depends on [readline library](http://cnswww.cns.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html) and [libconfig](http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/), which are not included in OS X by default. You have to install these libraries manually.

If using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/):

     brew install libconfig readline lua python libevent jansson
     export CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.3.8/include"
     export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/Cellar/readline/6.3.8/lib"
     ./configure && make

Thanks to [@jfontan](https://github.com/vysheng/tg/issues/3#issuecomment-28293731) for this solution.

If using [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org):
     
     sudo port install libconfig-hr
     sudo port install readline
     sudo port install lua51
     sudo port install python34
     sudo port install libevent
     export CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include -I/opt/local/include -I/opt/local/include/lua-5.1"
     export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib -L/opt/local/lib -L/opt/local/lib/lua-5.1"
     ./configure && make

Install these ports:

* devel/libconfig
* devel/libexecinfo
* lang/lua52

Then build:

     env CC=clang CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib LUA=/usr/local/bin/lua52 LUA_INCLUDE=-I/usr/local/include/lua52 LUA_LIB=-llua-5.2 ./configure
     make

#### Other UNIX

If you manage to launch it on other UNIX, please let me know.

### Contacts 
If you would like to ask a question, you can write to my telegram or to the github (or both). To contact me via telegram, you should use import_card method with argument 000653bf:0738ca5d:5521fbac:29246815:a27d0cda


### Usage

    bin/telegram-cli -k <public-server-key>
    
By default, the public key is stored in tg-server.pub in the same folder or in /etc/telegram-cli/server.pub. If not, specify where to find it:

    bin/telegram-cli -k tg-server.pub

Client support TAB completion and command history.

Peer refers to the name of the contact or dialog and can be accessed by TAB completion.
For user contacts peer name is Name <underscore> Lastname with all spaces changed to underscores.
For chats it is it's title with all spaces changed to underscores
For encrypted chats it is <Exсlamation mark> <underscore> Name <underscore> Lastname with all spaces changed to underscores. 

If two or more peers have same name, <sharp>number is appended to the name. (for example A_B, A_B#1, A_B#2 and so on)
